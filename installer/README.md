This directory contains installer scripts for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Each platform has three different installer variants for service, service-user and session-user

If you update one installer script, you may need to update the corresponding scripts on the other platforms/installation types as well. Before committing any changes, please review all related installer scripts to confirm that necessary updates have been made across platforms/installation types.
